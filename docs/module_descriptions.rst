Module Descriptions
===================

The functionality of dRep is broken up into modules. The user can run the modules separately, or together in workflows.

Work Directory
--------------

The work directory is where all of the program's internal workings, log files, cached data, and output is stored. When running dRep modules multiple times on the same dataset, **t is essential* that you use the same work directory so the program can find the results of previous runs.

For help finding where the output from your run is located in the work directory, see :doc:`interpreting_output`

For access to the raw internal data (which can be very useful), see :doc:`advanced_use`
