Raw data

Almost data that dRep generates at any point is able to be accessed by the user. This includes the full checkM results of each genome, the value of all genome comparisons, the raw hierarchical clustering files, the primary and secondary cluster identity of each genome, etc.

For information on where all of this is hidden, see :doc:`advanced use`
